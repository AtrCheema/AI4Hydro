| Sun, A. Y., Scanlon, B. R., Zhang, Z., Walling, D., Bhanja, S. N., Mukherjee, A., & Zhong, Z. (2019). Combining physically based modeling and deep learning for fusing GRACE satellite data: Can we learn from mismatch?. Water Resources Research, 55(2), 1179-1195. https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR023333  |   &#9745;   | &#9744; | &#9744; | &#9744;  |  |

The &#9745; for `explainable-AI` means the developed approach contributes towards explainable-AI in a loose sense. It includes, theory-driven, knowledge-driven, physics-driven, physics-guided, interpretable models.

The # &#9745; for `data` means that the study either solely introduces new dataset or uses a pre-existing dataset but makes it open source through this study.

The &#9745; for `code` the code to implement the paper is available. In such a case, a link is also provided here.

The &#9745; for `hybrid` means the the developoed methodology is not a pure single machine/deep learning based rather it combines different deep learning and or machine learning approaches possible involving some physically-based model, driving the benefit from each other.

The `reviews` tab if available, will direct to any review/synopsis or presentation around the study.

## Contirbute

Your contributions especially if you made a review/comment about a particular paper and you want to share that with others like [this](https://github.com/AtrCheema/AI4Hydro/blob/master/Water/reviews/Prediction of Chlorophyll-a Concentrations in the Nakdong River.pptx) is highly always welcome.
